1. If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

2. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare,
BFS (DFS will take long time. )

3. If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

4. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
DFS

5. determining whether a path exists between two nodes
DFS

6. Finding the shortest path
BFS
